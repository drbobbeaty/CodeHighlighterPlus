CodeHighlighterPlus
===================

### Introduction

I have been using WordPress for a personal blog for many years. Before that,
everything was in a PostgreSQL database with journaling software I wrote
myself. Before that it was static HTML pages. This is going back to _before_
Y2K. But one thing that I always wanted in the journal was a nice syntax
highlighter.
[CodeHighlighter](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/code-highlighter/) was
_nearly_ perfect.

This is a slight _fork_ of that becauce it also fixes some problems in
[GeSHI](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/) as well. Also, the original
[CodeHighlighter](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/code-highlighter/) is
evidently not on GitHub. So I've started this project, and it's something
that I'll maintain as needed - pulling in [GeSHI](http://qbnz.com/highlighter/)
changes and adding things as I need them.
